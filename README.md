# Python_exploratory_analysis
Exploratory analysis of the World Happiness Report (2015-2019) using Python
# Motivation
The World Happiness Report reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
# Goal
The objective of this case study is to find out which countries are the happiest and why (i.e., what factors play the biggest role in determining happiness).
# Data
The rankings in this analysis use data from the Gallup World Poll. In addition to using the Gallup weights to calculate a happiness score, the contributions of six factors – Family, GDP per Capita, Health, Freedom, Generosity, and Trust – when making life evaluations are calculated.
